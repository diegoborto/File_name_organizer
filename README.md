# File_name_organizer
On your HDD there are tons of old pictures and videos with different name type, creating chaos in the folder order. Also, the computer is reading the incorrect date for the photos. Sounds familiar? I wrote this program to rename the selected picture with its date of creation, making order in your folders.
The program retrives metadata from the photo itself and from the file, giving you the possibility to choose which one to use for the file name.

Future improvments for the program:
1. Selecting a folder and then giving you the possibility to choose for every file what to do (DONE)
2. Adding support for MP4 videos (DONE)
